**Background**

<p>For one of my final projects as an Information Technology & Informatics student, I was tasked with formulating and documenting a comprehensive and realistic information privacy policy for a fictional global medical corporation. This capstone-styled project spanned approximately two to three weeks and was structed as an intensive, team-based exercised. Over the course of the project, my team and I engaged in multiple rounds of drafting, peer review, and revision as we worked to refine our policy to the highest standard possible within the given timeframe.</p> 
<p>Our objectives were multifaceted and included three main focuses: establish clear, accessible guidlines for a non-technical audience, address and integrate relevant global, national, and state-level privacy laws and regulations, and mitigate potential risks to organizational operations and assets. From the outset, we placed strong emphasis on creating a policy that was both transparent and highly detailed. This decision was informed by our market research phase during which we examined existing privacy policies from a range of industries and found that many lacked clarity, specificity, or user-friendly explanations.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical and legal components, the project required navigating challenges in coordinating an interdisciplinary team under a fast-paced schedule and with intentionally ambiguous project parameters. Please feel free to check out the final, high-quality version of our policy document! üóíÔ∏è </p>
