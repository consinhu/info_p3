**Background**
My final project for one of my last classes in college as an Information Technology & Informatics student involved formulating and documenting a realistic information privacy policy for a fictional global medical corporation. This was also an extended team-based exercise over a period of about 2 to 3 weeks where we drafted, revised, and finalized the policy on a strict schedule in a purposefully ambiguous environment. Our project objectives included defining clear guidelines for a non-technical audience, outlining relevant global, national, and state-level laws and regulations, and reducing the potential adverse effects on organizational operations and assets. 

**Key Laws and Regulations**
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- HITECH
- CMIA
- CPRA
- FIPPs
- NIST SP 800-53
